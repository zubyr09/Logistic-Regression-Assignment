# Logistic Regression Assignment - Supervised Machine Learning (Coursera)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Logistic Regression** assignment from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supervised Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera</a>. The goal of this assignment is to implement **Logistic Regression** from scratch and apply it to two different datasets to predict outcomes based on input features.

## Introduction
**Logistic regression** is a Supervised Learning Algorithm used for **Binary Classification**. Unlike Linear Regression, it predicts probabilities using the logistic (sigmoid) function. This assignment focuses on implementing logistic regression from scratch using *NumPy* & & *Matplotlib* and evaluating its performance on two different classification datasets:
1. **Binary classification** (`ex2data1.txt`).
2. **Non-linear classification with feature mapping** (`ex2data2.txt`).

## Dataset
The datasets are stored in the `Dataset` branch. Click the filenames below to download them directly:
1. **[ex2data1.txt](https://github.com/zubyr09/Logistic-Regression-Assignment/raw/Dataset/ex2data1.txt)**  
   - **Binary classification**: Predict admission based on exam scores.  
   - Columns: `Exam 1 Score`, `Exam 2 Score`, `Admission Status` (0 = not admitted, 1 = admitted).  
2. **[ex2data2.txt](https://github.com/zubyr09/Logistic-Regression-Assignment/raw/Dataset/ex2data2.txt)**  
   - **Non-linear classification**: Predict microchip QA pass/fail using feature mapping.  
   - Columns: `Test 1 Result`, `Test 2 Result`, `QA Status` (0 = fail, 1 = pass).  


## Implementation
### Code File: `Logistic_Regression_Code.ipynb`
The Jupyter Notebook [`Logistic_Regression_Code.ipynb`](Logistic_Regression_Code.ipynb) includes:
- Data visualization (e.g., scatter plots of classes).
- Sigmoid function and cost calculation.
- Gradient descent optimization.
- Decision boundary plotting.
