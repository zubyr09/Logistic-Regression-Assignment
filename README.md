# Logistic Regression Assignment - Supervised Machine Learning (Coursera)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Logistic Regression** assignment from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supervised Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera</a>. The goal of this assignment is to implement **Logistic Regression** from scratch and apply it to two different datasets to predict outcomes based on input features.

## Introduction
**Logistic regression** is a Supervised Learning Algorithm used for **Binary Classification**. Unlike Linear Regression, it predicts probabilities using the logistic (sigmoid) function. This assignment focuses on implementing logistic regression from scratch using *NumPy* & & *Matplotlib* and evaluating its performance on two different classification datasets. 

## Implementation
### Code File: `Logistic_Regression_Code.ipynb`
The Jupyter Notebook [`Logistic_Regression_Code.ipynb`](Logistic_Regression_Code.ipynb) includes:
- Data visualization (e.g., scatter plots of classes).
- Sigmoid function and cost calculation.
- Gradient descent optimization.
- Decision boundary plotting.
